## How It Works

- **Create Ventures:** Entrepreneurs can start a venture, sharing their business idea and seeking funding from others.
- **Fund Ventures:** Users can back ventures they believe in, as long as they meet the minimum funding requirement.
- **Manage Funds:** Entrepreneurs can request to use the funds for specific needs, but only if the backers approve.
- **Approve Requests:** Funders get to vote on spending requests. The funds are only released if a majority says yes, making sure everything’s on the up-and-up.

## Features

- **Wallet Connection:** Easily connect your wallet to get started.
- **Venture Creation:** Entrepreneurs can launch new ventures and look for funding.
- **Fund Management:** Funds are managed transparently, with funders voting on spending requests.
