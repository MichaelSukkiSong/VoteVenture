# VoteVenture

**VoteVenture** is a dApp that helps entrepreneurs turn their ideas into ventures, with the community's help. It's all about transparency—users can fund ventures, and those funds are managed fairly through the power of smart contracts on the blockchain.

## How It Works

- **Create Ventures:** Entrepreneurs can start a venture, sharing their business idea and seeking funding from others.
- **Fund Ventures:** Users can back ventures they believe in, as long as they meet the minimum funding requirement.
- **Manage Funds:** Entrepreneurs can request to use the funds for specific needs, but only if the backers approve.
- **Approve Requests:** Funders get to vote on spending requests. The funds are only released if a majority says yes, making sure everything’s on the up-and-up.

## Features

- **Wallet Connection:** Easily connect your wallet to get started.
- **Venture Creation:** Entrepreneurs can launch new ventures and look for funding.
- **Fund Management:** Funds are managed transparently, with funders voting on spending requests.
- **Real-time Price Feeds:** Thanks to Chainlink, we’ve got up-to-date price feeds to ensure accurate funding.
- **Voting System:** Funders have a say in how the money is spent, keeping things fair and transparent.
